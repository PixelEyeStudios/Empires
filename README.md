# Empires
A Castlepunk, Fantasy mod which allows players to build, develop and expand their kingdoms and their ruling domains, build armies and make alliances or enemies. This is a mod designed with conflict in mind. It can grief, especially in battles and this is intended but there are ways in the mod to repair any damage during war to make up for it.
